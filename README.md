# Media Catalogue
A project whose intention was to make a catalogue of all media. Books were the starting place, because they seemed to have the fewest details. It was envisioned that another database would be linked, probably via some API, to search by title and allow users to choose the books that most closely matched what they read, owned, or wanted from their wishlists. So far, only the title and a few attributes may be entered. Books may be searched within a local database and copied, edited, and deleted, but the result can only be printed to screen and not written to file within the typical security framework of a browser.
## Getting Started
The files needed are index.html, css/custom.css, js/script.js, and js/data.js (the latter of which may be modified as desired). If while loading index.html, the browser is unable to reach the various CDN sites then css/bootstrap.min.css, js/jquery-3.2.1.slim.min.js, js/popper.min.js, and js/bootstrap.min.js have been included as fallback files. Simply start the index.html in a browser to see what has been built thus far.
## Built With
   * HTML/CSS/JavaScript - as plain Jane as it gets
   * [Bootstrap](http://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/)/jQuery/Popper - Bootstrap has jQuery and Popper as dependencies
